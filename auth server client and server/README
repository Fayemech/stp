To compile:  
make 

To clen 
make clean

To run: first open three terminal then run as the follow command
./as <authserverport> <clientID> <clientkey> <serverID> <serverkey>
./server <server port> <serverkey>
./client <authservername> <authserverport> <clientkey> <server name> <server port> <clientID> <serverID>

After succeed run, The AS server will print out "AS finish its work".
Server will print out "One sentence", "server finish work here". I let the server print out the pdata it recieved from the client in order to check the progress. 
Client will print "OK", followed by the "Decrypt data", "Encrypt data".


Basically, my three files works fine. If it has problem, please let me know.
