extra for queen problem;
fourqueenConstraint as new type of constraint.
cause when queen == N;
if N == 1 || N >= 4 queen problem can solve;
so I only implment N == 4;
but it's pretty same if we want to increased N;
just use A B C D E F，，，，，，，，

run it as autograder.py -t ./extra/queen.test

In the solution part, I only list the solution that the autograder give me, it will have other mirror or rotation solution.
